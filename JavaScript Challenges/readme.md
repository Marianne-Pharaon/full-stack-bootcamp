## Goal of Challenge 4

- Mastery over Arrays and Objects.
- Delve into Destructuring Arrays and Objects.
- Explore and Implement the Spread Operator.

## Step 1: Arrays and Objects

### Array Creation
Declare an array named `fiveNumbers` and initialize it with five distinct numbers of your choice.

### Object Creation
Construct an object named `personalInfo` with the following properties: name, age, height, location, and nationality. Assign suitable values to each property.

Commit: "Challenge 4 - Done with step 1".

## Step 2: Spread Operator

### New Array with Spread
Declare another array named `nextThreeNumbers` and initialize it with three numbers.
Using the spread operator, create a new array named `allNumbers` which combines the numbers from both `fiveNumbers` and `nextThreeNumbers`.

### New Object with Spread
Construct another object named `additionalInfo` with properties like occupation, hobby, and education.
Using the spread operator, create a new object named `fullInfo` which merges the properties from both `personalInfo` and `additionalInfo`.

## Step 3: Destructuring

### Destructuring Arrays
Using array destructuring, extract the first three numbers from the `fiveNumbers` array into three distinct variables: `firstNum`, `secondNum`, and `thirdNum`.

### Destructuring Objects
Using object destructuring, extract the name, location, and nationality properties from the `personalInfo` object into three separate variables with the same names.

## Bonus Step: Advanced Operations

### Nested Destructuring
Imagine you have an object that has another object as one of its properties. E.g., `contactInfo` object inside `personalInfo`. Try to destructure properties from this nested object in a single line.

### Rest with Destructuring
Use the rest operator in combination with destructuring to extract the first two numbers from the `fiveNumbers` array into individual variables and the remaining numbers into a new array named `restOfNumbers`.

### Merging and Overwriting with Spread
Create two objects with some overlapping properties. Use the spread operator to merge them, but make sure properties from the second object overwrite those from the first.
